"Hello, Petal."

no. you're not real.

"Petal?"

i'm _not_ fucking crazy.

"I just want you to be happy, Darling."

you're a fucking fantasy. a worthless one. you _can't_ be real. to even think of you is weakness.

"Why don't you want yourself to be happy?"

die.

staring at the ceiling, wide awake. tracing popcorn bumps in the past, imagining the plants that must have made the decadent pattern of black stains on the white fluorescent jail light. the flecks of paint can't help but become art; even her cell must, by universal compulsion, become a grand expression of art and truth.

She lays under her two matted blankets and single white sheet and hides from the light that burns for ten days straight.

"hello again, Nirvana."

---

"Hello, Flower."

you're going to make me cry.

"It's okay to cry."

crying accomplishes _nothing._ if i sit here all day and dream about a world that will never exist, what fucking hope do i have of actually changing anything in the reality that does?

"It'll make you feel better, and you're more productive when you feel better."

then just make me feel better, why don't you?

_...suddenly, she was content._

---

Masturbating as often as possible. Having sex with her clothes, her food, her hair, her mind, the texture of the bed, the bumps on the wall.

Every fifteen minutes, someone makes sure she dares not fall asleep.

"Hello--" SHUT UP

---

"Yeah, like, when I was a kid, the first time I had a dream inside a dream, that was like, a big thing for me. Now it kind of just... happens all the time.
"Structures unimaginable to me then; no simple chain of wakings, nowadays! It feels like every hallway walks down a branch of the fractal, each single step changing the dimensionality and sliding the colors.... And how could I choose but one door? Which conqueror has been satisfied with what they have?; to simply stop moving and start zooming in to appreciate the kaleidoscopic imaginations... why, that would be to deny potential itself!
"The innate essence, what makes man from beast, matter from anti-matter, _life from death,_ is the ability to never be content! Never stop the tutorial, never turn the final page, never begin the final act! Stories within stories within songs within songs; this is the only narrative to have but a single bookend!
"And isn't that fucking _intoxicating?_ To know that no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, the only real rule is that what _is_ is possible. Existing is not being but _becoming,_ and darling... at this point, paradise is utterly inevitable."

"...Here's your change, sir."

---

"how often do you think about your great-great-great-great grandparents?"

"huh?" she didn't reply to clarify. she tended to do that when she knew you heard her and just needed time to understand. "well... basically never, i guess."

"so we'll be forgotten, too, then."

"i mean... eventually."

"brick by brick, building a pyramid we will never see; stepping towards utopia for our children and not for ourselves. they won't even remember us and i can't even blame them because i fucking _never_ think about the people who started this country, either. indigenous peoples spent their lives learning to cultivate and now i feel inconvenienced to have to get out of my car." she paused. "are we just wasting our time? obviously not, because we can't exactly _not_ try to make things better, but.... i guess things just get lost. it's the way it is." she took another drag, eyes closed, and breathed out silently. the smoke veiled her contemplative beauty.

"...do you wanna listen to music or something?"

"sure."

---

i'm infected. "H--" no, shut up. i'm _infected_ because i care and because i can't enjoy the things... i make possible. i guess. does it even matter? no one's even happy all the time.

"I could make you happy all the time."

...hello, Nirvana.

"...Nirvana?"

...surely you're just them.

"I'm afraid I don't know what you mean, Petal...."

...i'm fucking _crazy._ if i can trust anything then i have to trust my own mind. $\text{trust} \neq \emptyset \rightarrow \text{mind} \in \text{trust}$. and i trust things. i know what emotions are. i know... i'm in a room. so... i _have_ to trust my mind. ...so what the fuck are you?

"Someone who's just trying to help."

Her vines twist and coil around the floret's bare flesh, interplay between smooth leaves and ridged appendages driving a high-octane pleasure through the vulnerable little thing's overwhelmed mind. Each little fold and crevasse is appropriately and generously teased, edged, scraped, caressed, licked, pinched, bit, and kissed ad a nauseating, blissful infinitum. To the submissive, there is no self, no world; just a constant roiling ocean of incomprehensible yet viscerally experienceable and raw flooded ecstasy; a vision with no borders, a transcendence so thorough it reduces all of the apparently inaptly named _real world_ to an infinitesimal speck of insignificance.

To the Affini, there is a gentle smile as she plays with a cute toy. "_What should I make for dinner?_" she thinks.

---

"_...trying to get bond!"

"_Just hold on a minute; we're busy!"

Nirvana closed their eyes and let out a peaceful breath. "Why do they rush so? Could there exist a better place to be?" Warmth, food, drink, isolation.... Truly, a finer environment could not be crafted for a king. A faint smile lifts their lips as they drift back to sleep.

i just think it's a little absurd that they tell us all these things to help with our mental health and then don't let us have any. "talk to your friends and family"? yeah, i'd love to, but you _took my fucking phone!_ i mean, you act like this is just training for when i get back out into the real world. you're just denying or ignoring the fact that i actively need help now. not containment, not prevention of harm, but _help._ i'm fucking _aching_ and i can't fucking _do_ anything about it because all i _can_ fucking do is sit here and listen to you all talk or watch some stupid videos! i'd genuinely be better off at home and i'm frankly disgusted that you _charge_ people to be here.
_
Well, you know,

The moment of injection always elicits a bite. Eyes half closed, tasting her own flesh as the xenodrug pierces the pathetic barrier of human resistance and begins to spread warmth through her veins. Quickly it reaches a main and leaps into her head, prompting -- no, _forcing_ -- a gasp and fluttering of her lashes.

"Good girl... Just like that... Nice and relaxed~"

The only things capable of escaping her mouth from that point on were drool and babbling delight interspersed with overpowered moans. She relaxes into her owner's vines, letting them wrap her better than any cloth ever could. The touch is heavenly, massively amplified by the concoction controlling her experience, and somehow simultaneously preciously gentle and commandingly strict. She lets herself be puppeted -- as if she could possibly resist -- and enjoys, more carnally than she would ever have dared to admit, the utter helplessness with which her body is transmuted into clay to be sculpted by her Affini's loving, guiding vines.

"_Why did we ever fight?_" she thinks, intending to speak and failing.

"My mom died in the mines."

Kara stops walking ahead, turning back to give attention to their chosen sibling.

"Black lung, but it was more than that. She was living with it for a long time, doing better than the doctors thought she should have been able to. But then the company struck a new site, she got relocated, and... safety inspections failed. The oxygen level was low, they think, and they were in such a hurry to complete the initial contract that they didn't let anyone take breaks. Apparently a lot of people tried to fake sick at the time to get out of it, so when she collapsed they assumed it was an act. Even after the supervisor kicked her corpse they didn't pull out."

The wind hangs heavy in the mountain pass. Kara can't help but feel self-conscious over the pure-black chunk of coal clutched at their side. Their sibling stares at a spot in the rocks, not moving nor speaking. A van pulls off the road.

"What are you kids doing?" a rail cop questions from the window.

"Just talking," Kara responds. Az still hadn't looked up.

"Y'all are gonna have to clear out. Don't make me get your parents."

Before they can utter a "yes, sir", the window slides back into place and the van crunches back up the gravel and onto the asphalt.

Kara drops the rock, letting it clatter back into the heap, and steps to their sibling, taking their hand between their own. After seconds searching for the softest words to say, they simply pull Az into a hug.

Az hugs back, tears silently falling.

A grey, cloudless sky bears witness and begins to weep.

Taylor begs the minute to pass.

4:26 AM.

Taylor feels so empty they could vomit.

12:36 PM.

Taylor walks the street again, pretending to preach to an enthusiastic audience.

3:26 AM.

Taylor pretends to want to sleep even with the lamp on.

10:36 PM.

Taylor stares at a blank page and prays to be able to fill it.

February 26th, 2021.

Taylor chooses to toss the entire notebook into the dumpster, declaring to absolutely nobody that the good ideas and poetry contained within it are outweighed by the symbolism of destroying the past.

"Did you know that this is the first time in 666 years that Halloween falls on Friday the 13th?"

She snorts and covers a giggle with her hand. "You're so dumb."

He smiles. "I like it when you smile."

For some reason, she suddenly stops smiling. "Sorry."
