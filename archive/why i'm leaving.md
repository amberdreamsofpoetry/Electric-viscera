i was manipulated into coming here by my mom.

i spent years trying to distance myself from her because of the way she treats me. i finally cut all ties with her and went no-contact. i was happily homeless at the time, living out of my car.

she came and found me, forcing herself back into my life, and in the process forcing me back into my old life. she took my car and convinced me that it was for my own good. she told me that i'm broken and need to be fixed.

i am not happy here. it is loud, my time is being wasted, and i am not free. i am going to go back to kentucky to receive support from my friends and to go back to school.

i do not want or need to be here.

We were homeless, and addicted to THCÂ·. My mom found us after we had given up most of our things in a state of severe intoxication. She took us off the street, bought us a bunch of food, put us in a hotel, and told us about this recovery center. We agreed to come because we were led to believe that we would have much more freedom and autonomy than we actually do. We did need help breaking the addiction. We have gotten that help and I do not plan on using ever again. I know the proper coping skills and what to do in case of a trigger. I will not use again. My mother believes that there is a fundamental problem with someone who prefers to be homeless. That is objectively untrue; it is my preference, just as my preference is not to have her in my life. She was okay with neither of those facts, and so she forced her way back in and convinced us, in her motherly way, that we were desperate for her. We were not. We had everything that we needed, and we were much, much happier than we are now or we had been before. We don't have our car anymore, but we will work with our friends to save up to get it back so that we can go back to our happiness. At the same time, we will work on getting back to school so that we can start to pursue a career. The university provides housing and support to people like us.

I'm tired of not making progress. I'm tired of all the noise. I'm tired of being treated like a child.
