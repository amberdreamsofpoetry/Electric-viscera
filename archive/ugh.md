My laptop is an accessibility accommodation. I need it even when I am not in clinical. I will not use the WiFi if that is what is required, but I can also swear that I will not violate HIPPA. I am willing to work with you all on this, but I absolutely cannot stand for my coping mechanism being taken away from me in the environment where I have the least control and in which I need it most. I really would rather avoid having to suffer the winter, but I spent an entire month without this and I am not capable of being without it for any longer. Please let me speak with whoever I need to speak to in order to make this happen.
