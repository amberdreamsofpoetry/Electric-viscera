Electrons have a variable and not well-defined mass.

Electrons do not have a well-defined velocity; they have a probability of being at various locations in space.

___

Maybe the universe is a very large TSP with the targets being areas instead of fixed points, in line with the one electron universe.

How does a model understand context? When reading a very old text, for example, is only the brief bits of foreword and a date enough to weigh down the entire duration of the work as old and potentially outdated? Is it taken in by the narrative on the scale of paragraph to paragraph, convinced that it is true, only to come out of a sort of stupor on the scale of the book and recontextualize the entire thing as a sort of fiction, or is it colored the entire time, sentence by sentence, with the preface that what it is taking in must be taken with a grain of salt and any understandings gained there within must be taken as purely contextual?
We feed it our entire corpus of information, hundreds of thousands of millions of lifetimes, and it processes it in less than one, coming out with an understanding greater than that of any human individual. We can recognize the result perfectly well, but we know so very little about the _experience_ of that learning. Is the modern model basically the same whether we give it our history or not, having the capacity to disregard the falsehoods that come with scientific innovation, or is there something more to be derived from that history, that rich context of misunderstandings? Are we only the result of our works, or are we the works themselves, in their entire history of misconception?

no matter what, quanta are not _infinitely_ small. they are the smallest possible, but it is easier to conceive of something smaller than the limit below which nothing can exist; it is simply beyond this universe. or perhaps i am splitting hairs, retreading the words of critics of calculus. what is the difference between the infinitesimal and zero? are we really so close to the absolute bottom of things as to be able to see the grid lines, as it were? if so, what can be said about the continuity of everything? is everything fundamentally smooth, as in calculus, or is reality "blocky", divided into right angles? perhaps neither? perhaps there are certain smallest distances but a much more lenient smallest angle, allowing for axes even on the smallest scales which create pockets of space with distances between one and two Planck units, but which we could only detect as one or the other in isolation?

___

the wavelength is a sort of identity for an object, mapping the reals to reality. the only meaningful question, already knowing the minimum, becomes "what is the maximum?"

___

a UFT allows perfect prediction, which is fundamentally impossible. what we have is close to the best that we will get. the rules change as a function of scale and are continuous through gradual change. however, we will always fail when trying to take a shortcut from the very small to the very large, as the function changes too much along that range to allow for predictions which are both accurate and use a consistent means; the only way to _solve_ an NP-complete problem, rather than get a good estimate, is one step at a time. unless we figure out the rate of change of the laws of physics through scale, as it were, we will have no UFT.

my best guess is that empty rows simply pop out of existence, bringing that which is gradually closer as long as nothing is cut by the loss. this process would be determined by what the universe considers a row at the time, thus making it quantum and inherently unpredictable unless taken en mass, in which case the laws of statistics come through to assist. that is, gravity is the statistical measure of events which are fundamentally unobservable on the quantum scale, as they require both no observer and no observed in order to take place. much more difficult to notice than a tree falling in an empty forest.

___

the fundamental question of quantum mechanics is "are observers special?" can we manufacture them? are they a unique quality of intelligence? are they, in a sense, metaphysical or "magic"? if not, are they simply the result of entanglements of proportions monolithically more vast than we could ever understand or separate ourselves from, and what we are doing is the equivalent of trying to find a needle in the cosmos? as a firm believer in reality, i support the latter. but you know what they say about magic and things which we don't understand.

___

"...the behavior of a hydrogen atom in a system independent of time constraints." what does _that_ mean? are we supposing time and space are fundamentally different again, because how would you consider behavior absent _space?_

___

maybe only the most recent tests are looked at; for quantum events, the universe has a short memory. the universe demands it using the principle of least action back through time stemming from the point of the observation. maybe.

___

the universe seems content to violate causality as long as it does so invisibly; the principle of eventual consistency.

___

is _every_ photon an interaction mediator between charged particles, even those that travel a great distance? if so, what of those which terminate at singularities--or event horizons?
