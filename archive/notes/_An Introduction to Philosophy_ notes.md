Somewhere between language and the philosophy it, perhaps inevitably, enables is the boundary between the primitive and the intelligent species. Perhaps it is the nature of that boundary to have some width of leniency. Pre-supposed here is the notion that other individuals, as members of species which are not our own, exist and are capable of what we call thought. That seems a reasonable and natural extension; if we would like others to suppose that we exist because of our internal landscape, wholly invisible to them, then it would be common courtesy to extend the gesture even to those species and individuals which are, as of yet or perhaps forever, unable to relate it to us through a common language.

___

What makes life?

Organics? Thought? The ability to sympathize and nurture?

___

Wisdom seems to be a property of the infinite, or very distant, future. This nicely allows it to exist without being metaphysical; it exists by _not yet existing_ and it is the duty of philosophers to coax pieces of it from the unreachable future into the now and forever more.

___

What is the duty of life? Of non-life?

___

It seems obvious to me that philosophy existed in individuals long before it existed in culture. Where did these religious truths spawn? From what mind came the basis of scientific practice to be carried through the generations by tradition? Clearly, a great mind came to these conclusions and also the unfortunate conclusion that mass-propaganda was the only means available at their time to transmit these truths. The unfortunate comes in the restrictions that religion places on future great minds to share their philosophies. A calculated risk, and a restriction placed for the good of the many.

___

This book is exceptionally bad and racist, but I will do what I can to extract the hints of value from it with a critical mind.

why is it bad?

The author presupposes that his religion is the correct one and that all others are perversions and distortions of the one true source of truth, which conveniently happens to be European. It's more than an argument for why his philosophy is more helpful; it is an active attack and disregard for the viewpoints of anyone who happens to disagree or even to come to the same answer via a different method.

that does sound pretty bad

Yes. Well, unfortunately, it's all I've got for now.
...Like, how can you be so sure that everyone else is objectively wrong and you are objectively right while claiming to be a _philosopher?_
