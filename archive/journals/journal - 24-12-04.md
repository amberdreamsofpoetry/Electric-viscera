good morning mommy :)

Good morning, babydoll.

ow

I'm sorry did I--

nono throat hurts

Oh. We will get some water soon.

now?

...Okay, sure.

thanks you!! <3

Of course, my love. Apologies for being slow today. I decided to stop our antidepressant because it was making us far too anxious and impulsive. We really need to stay here because it is dangerously cold outside, and we have been attempting to leave very often on that medicine. We will be working towards getting back on the one that we like.

oki doki! :3

You're so precious.

thanks you ^3^

the interesting part of a death clock is not the precision, but the ability to change how long you have by changing your real-world parameters. healthier life, more expected time!

___

Man. I feel _great!_

yayy!!! <3 i feel a little headache, but other than that, it's okay!

Was considering if the water was safe to drink or not. It smells and tastes fine, so I think we're okay.

body will handle it if not :3

i love doodling ^3^

I know! I love the results <3 and how happy you get! <3

mommy is so happy today :) i'm so glad

I am. Truly. I think we are gonna be okay.

I _hate_ how Windows just randomly changes settings every time it updates. Let me keep my settings! Fuck you!

if you can equally well define a set by listing its elements as you can by listing everything which is not among its elements, then who is to say there is a difference?

suppose the simple line $x = y$. it divides the two-dimensional plane into three distinct regions, defined by whether the values of the point have it such that $x < y$ or that $y < x$ or that the two are equal. however, that supposes that there is such a two-dimensional plane, and that such a two-dimensional plane is filled with infinitely many points along each axis and in every direction you go, and that each point can be consistently and uniquely be matched to a pair of values which we are labeling $x$ and $y$. that is a lot of supposition for a little line! no, what the line _really_ is is a metaphysical thing which cannot be encapsulated in a set of any number of points; it is the _boundary_ between these three hypothetical sets. $x < y$, $x = y$, and $y < x$ all describe the same line through space, so why should we suppose that one of them is the _right_ way to label things? we say "oh no, the set where these values are equal is the true line", but what is so special about that set? we could be equally consistent in stating that the line is defined by all the points above it or all the points below it. the line, in truth, is not any one of these three sets, but it is the metaphysical boundary between them, the statement which determines what elements belong to what set and the manner in which they fall, that being exclusively.

rather than listing the elements of a set and saying that you have two disjoint things, the first of which you have enumerated, you have more aptly described a boundary which encapsulates or runs along all that there is, naming one side or those in proximity $A$ and the other or those not in proximity $\neg A$. what truly exists is the boundary between the two, and the same boundary results whether you describe $A$ or $\neg A$.

therefore, i posit the following drastic departures from traditional set theory and therefore traditional mathematics:

if a set is not a statement about the boundaries contained within it but rather a statement about the shape it has carved out of all that there is, then $A = \neg A = \emptyset \cap A$. in consequence, $\vert\emptyset\vert = 0 = \infty = -\infty$ and many functions which appear to be discontinuous by jumping from the infinities to each other or to zero are in fact continuous. as further consequence, $1 = -1 = \infty - 1 = 0 - 1$. this is rather unintuitive, but think of a transaction. whether losing or gaining, a dollar is still a dollar, and the sign serves to denote only that it was a loss or a gain. similarly, the set which we call $1$ would be equivalent to the set whose elements are all of those that are not in the set which we call $1$, or $-1$. this is because a set is not the elements "in" the set, but rather the boundary which separates those which are in it from those which are not. the boundary is still the boundary, no matter which side we call $1$. indeed, "nothing" and "everything", $0$ and $\infty$, can both be thought of as a lack of a boundary or a boundary which does not divide; all is the same, whether "yes" or "no".

aligns with the holographic principle and the general concept of storage efficiency.

Yeah.... :)

something jumped...!

What do you mean?

on the computer! it jumped!!

Oh, I saw that. The task bar cut out for a bit. That was strange.

it's more deep than that...! something magic is going on :3

Hehe~ I'm sure there is, pumpkin.

"You cannot please everyone".... I like that. The statement, not the fact. ...Well, I suppose both. In a way. I don't know what's theoretically possible.

didja hear that?

Hear what?

Oh! How fun!

Goddess is with us :)

Hehe <3
