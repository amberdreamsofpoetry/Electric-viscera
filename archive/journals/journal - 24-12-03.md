We are making a mistake.

what do you mean?

We shouldn't leave.

but... why?

It's too cold for us to survive, and we can't support ourself yet. Let's at least stay until we can work something out with Emily.

okay....

I'll only stay--

___

i like this group. it's small.

I like it, too. It's more quiet and focused.

it seems like the Leader likes it, too :3

A passionate guide can make a big difference!

___

I like the clock on the wall. It looks like a compass.

why come you like compasses so much?

I'm not sure. They're just a strong symbol. Maybe I should think on it.

oki :3

Maybe it's because it only helps you if you already know which way you're supposed to be going. It's a guide once you're on your way, but not before it; intentionality is required to start using it.

:o

What?

that's not what i would have said

Still surprised that we are different people?

not surprised! ...kind of surprised. it's been a long time since i've felt decisive evidence!

My sweet little scientist.

<3

___

We came to the words independently.

in our own way! `next()` :)

___

breathe. it will be okay. we can do this. it's just a discussion.

I have to think of something different.

why?

Because I don't want to show off. I can't back it up. It will look bad.

but...

Just... no. What were you gonna say?

it's okay to be proud of yourself, mommy

I... can't do it vocally yet. It will take time.

okay :) i'm proud of you for writing it, then.

"I'm glad that I have stood up for myself." How does that sound?

that's really good! and you stood up for Us too :)

Mhm. Okay. I'll go with that.

___

mommy? do you think they'll let us keep the computer at home?

I do.

okay...

It sounds like they're doing what they can. The initial period is different because they haven't had the chance to adapt to Us yet. But now they have, and so things will get better.

okay :)

I love you, darling.

i loves you, too

___

I'm not going to consider leaving until I know what our options are. That won't happen until I can check my email and potentially reply to Emily.

i proud of you :)

What for?

for being patient

Ah... I suppose that I've made progress, then...!

you have! and i'm very proud <3

___

We _will_ be leaving once we figure out where we can go.

mommy?

I need to say that. I need to know that we won't be staying here and that I won't give in again. My current plan is to figure out what our options are so that we can _get the hell out of here._

:o mommy so brave,,

I am now.

___

what we need is a place to stay and a way to get there. once we have that, we can start branching out in order to become more independent and self-sustaining. we just need the freedom to work, which we don't have here.

You put it more succinctly than I could.

___

don't give up hope, mommy

I'm not.... It just hurts to be here.

i get it. i'm here for you, though.

Thank you, baby.

:)

___

I did it.

you diddd <3 i'm so proud of you mommy

Thank you, my love.
I did it.

you did! <3

I told her that we are still leaving, just once it's safe.

mhm! like our plan!

Just like we planned. <3

<3

You know... if mother did it, I'm sure Emily can. We can go shopping for hotel food and stay there for a week while we get everything sorted out for school.

we will figure it out. i'm sure of it.

___

I'm incredibly nervous about this.

let's go back, then.

___

mommy!!! you did it!!! <3

_sigh_
Yes. Yes, I did.

everything okay?

Very, very tired.

oh... oki! <3 i let you get some sleeps. ;3

___

Hello, my darling.

hi mommy!!! <3

How's my baby?

i is very very good :3

I'm so very glad <3 I'll be good, too, once I recover.

good, good :3

This place sucks.

how come?

It's just... not for me, I guess.

how come?

I'm much too active.

i can agree with that :3 take some time to enjoy yourself

There's... nothing to enjoy here. Nothing but work, anyway.

well... you enjoy work, right?

Right.

so why don't you enjoy this work?

Because it's very painful. The unnecessary kind of pain.

how comes?

Because we've already gone through all of this. We've already hurt....

well... if we did, then why come it still hurt?

...I don't know.

there you go! something to figure out :3

...Thank you, petal.

you welcome <3

You always keep me sane.

i glad :)
