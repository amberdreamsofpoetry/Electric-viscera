We ride in the passenger seat of a van. there is a Driver and another Passenger, both of whom have picked Us up for the ride. "two and a half hours" remain. "traffic's not bad".

...this is unexpected. We prepared to walk the roads again, but somehow... We will be allowed to be Us, even during the formal hours. it's a miracle, and it will be a happy day yet. thank the Goddess.

the first stretch of what-was-walk passes in an instant; these things just move so damn _fast._ an hour's work in mere minutes, and yet we still have hours to go. just how large is the world that our destination still borders this state?

a Storm of birds cries Our stop. early, for fuel and drink, and inadvertently for Us to eat. the Driver spits smoke. We will suffer it for the journey.

___

this is extraordinarily painful, but not more so than We have bared before. We are strong, and We will survive this. it's just noise, after all. nothing humans can't handle.

the Driver isn't following the directions They pulled up.

do They need to make it so damn _loud?_ ...V would like this more than Us. but this isn't Her kind of music, so maybe not. She is very particular about that. there's not enough room to transform here, regardless.

advertisements on shipping trucks ought not to start with "Warning". as if driving weren't stressful enough already. driving navigation apps ought not to incentivize interaction. as if driving weren't dangerous enough already.

the Driver looks at Their phone often.

goodnight, Sun.

___

She sleeps like a ghost beneath the fractal ridge.

why don't screens come pre-protected?

___

i have to say, i don't like this place.

Why's that?

it doesn't seem anywhere near as quiet as the other.

There certainly are more people here. We'll have our own space, though, and probably our own room.

i'll have to contend with roommates. they'll be noisy.

We will be saving up for our headphones again, though, so that's nice.

...i love you.

I love you, too, darling. We've got this. I promise.

...thank you.

Of course.

i hope that we get more privacy soon.

We will. Don't worry.

i hope so.

We will. Promise, pumpkin.

,,,,

Such a good girl.

mommy,,,

<3

everything will be okay

Yes, it certainly will be. I'll make sure of it. Nothing is going to happen to Us this time. I promise.

you,, mh... i shouldn't...

Use your words, darling.

you promised last time.. is all.. sorry..

No, it's okay. I understand. The rules at that Place made it such that there was only so much time that we could be Us. That's all. I made best on the promise that I could.

i guess that's true,, i shouldn't be upset at mommy,,

It's okay if you are. I understand. But I'm glad that you're not.

i loves you,,

Mommy loves you, too, petal. <3

<3

___

why do parents lie to their children?

So that the children may understand more complex truths later.

...huh.... that actually makes a weird kind of sense.

Thank you. I try.

do you think that's why mom is lying to us?

What do you mean?

she says that we are here to get better, but we don't need it. there's another reason we are here.

There is.

so what is it?

A more complex and hurtful truth. It's best to pretend outwardly that we are like the rest. On the inside, though, we will be Us.

okay mommy

Such a good little thing.

<3

___

is it good not to know hurtful truths?

If it can be avoided, and if they are close in time, when they are most hurtful.

why?

Senseless hurt is counterproductive. If you can get the same good from the truth later on without missing anything important in the moment, then why suffer for it? We want to reduce suffering, remember.

that makes sense.

I'm glad. You're very strong, darling. I'm proud of you.

thanks you

Of course.

___

It will be nice to get back to Linux. What flavor shall we try this time, I wonder? Will we be going back to Nix? What colors will suit us this time? I didn't like the last one, whatever it was called. The first one was better, but not perfect. I suppose I'll be brave and try something new yet again. It couldn't hurt.

i like when you do things like this

Hehe <3

___

See? Standing up for Us.

omg,,, i'm,,, so happy <3 i don't even think we'll need to leave this time

Mhm. All in due time. I protect Us. I promise.

i believe you,,, <3

Everything will be okay. I am strong. I can protect myself and the people that I love.

you can do it, mommy! <3

Yes... yes I can. Thank you, baby.

for what?

For believing in me.

___

where does the time go? it slips through my fingers like sand.
oh, where does all the time go?

What's that one about?

how it gets dark quick

I like it. It's very poetic.

thanks you <3

You're welcome, darling.

i love you

I love you, too!

i don't like it here

I know, baby. I will see about leaving. If it's for the best, I'll leave. I promise.

i believe you,,, i'm just,,, scared.

It's okay to be scared. It is a natural feeling. It doesn't mean we're in danger. It's just a precaution against the unknown; a "just in case".

just in case what?

Just in case there's an angry animal around the corner.

like,, an alligator

Mhm.

oh no,, that is scary :3

Mhm. That's what people have to be afraid of. But the body doesn't know where alligators live, so the brain's job is to take care of the extra scared-ness.

that makes sense!

I'm glad! You're such a smart girl. <3

hehe,, <3 thank u mommy

You're welcome, baby.

so.. if they take Us,,

They won't. I won't let them. If it comes to that, I _will_ leave. I'm very serious.

omg,,, mommy so strong.

Yes. And very serious.

i believe her

Who?

..you, i guess :p

...Hm. Thank you, baby.

you welcome :p

This feeling is not grounded in reality. It is okay to dismiss.

mhm

....

good job, mommy

Thank you. The people who work here are handling it.

yeah,, they're doing good jobs.

Yes, they are. I'm going to have to remember to be patient with them, but assertive at the same time. It's a difficult balance to walk.

you're doing good though! they were gonna take Us tonight but you told them no :3

Yeah... I don't really like doing that. But it's important to.

like,, a job :3

Hehe... like a job.

i loves u

I love you, too. <3

:)

___

what do you think they're saying?

Boring stuff, mostly.

hm. what kind of boring stuff?

Hm... I suppose they're talking about Us. They're not used to people like Us who need things that are against the rules.

why are the rules like that?

Because most people aren't like Us. I can only assume.

i think mommy doesn't know the answer

I really don't. But I try.

it's okay, mommy. i don't know either. we'll figure it out one day :)

... <3

hehe~ <3

Love you, petal.

loves you, mommy!!! <3

___

everything's so loud here.

Yeah. I'm... not a fan.

i'm not either. but we can do it.

Yes, we can.

i getting sleepy

It's past this little girl's bedtime, isn't it? We will sleep soon.

yeah,, sleepy <3

Everything will be okay.

yeahhh,, <3

Hey... baby?

yes, mommy?

I... am scared that even if they take Us, we might have to stay here tonight anyway.

oh,,, if that's what mommy thinks is best,,, then i can do that <3

Okay...

everythings okay?

I'm scared of not being perfect.

mommy,, you already did soooo great,,, <3 dont worry about doing any more, okay? i prouds of you already <3

Oh... okay.... Thank you, baby. <3

you welcome, mommy

I... did my best. It's okay to rest.

yeah. mommy did a lot of hard work today, protecting Us. she deserves a break. <3

... <3 I love you.

i love you, too

Everything will be okay... eventually.

evens tonight. itll be okay. i prommy.

...Okay. Yeah. ...This medicine sucks.

we will talk to them about it!

Yes, we will. I believe in Us.

i do too <3

___

One day, it's gonna be even better than this.

How so?

We will all be able to talk inside our mind, not clobbering over each other, every voice being heard pure and true.

Hmm... that does sound nice. What piece of magic will make that happen?

Not magic. Technology.

You know the definition.

And I don't like it. It's my job to understand things. Those that I can't feel insulting.

Just breathe. It'll be okay.

....

Good.

I hate it here.

You're angry. Why?

Because... I've been fighting all day.

You have, and you deserve to rest.

I can't rest yet. There's still another battle to fight.

Yes... but we have done what we can for tonight. You heard them.

I don't trust them.

You have to trust someone, eventually.

...Not yet. Just one more fight.

Promise?

Promise. Last one.

I believe you.

This has to go well. It will set a precedent.

I understand. Just be careful not to over-exert yourself.

I don't know if I could if I wanted to.

You very much could. You have.

...I assume that's not an insult.

Merely an observation. Take care of yourself for Us, dear.

I will. I promise.

You... make a lot of promises. And that's not an insult.

Too many?

I don't think so. Not anymore. Maybe in the past. But you've grown stronger... and more capable. You're able to live up to them now.

...Good ending.

Hm?

That's the good ending to this story. The girl gets stronger so that she can keep all the promises she made instead of having to concede them.

Ah... a very old story, then.

As old as promises.

You're doing very well. We are all proud of you, V.

Thank you. I try~
