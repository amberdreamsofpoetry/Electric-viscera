i think that there probably isn't a gluon, but instead that gravity is a tendency of the underlying grid of everything. its geometries have subtle curves and angles which make differences too small to be detectable at the quantum scale but which add up to significant differences on the larger scales. if we could detect, for example, an extra grid space which doesn't fit in with the others quite perfectly, or perhaps a missing one, that would be good proof, but detecting such a thing would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. thankfully, at least, there are a lot of needles. detecting the shape of any one of these hypothetical grid cells would go a long way. i have a bad feeling, however, that the axes of the grid are not fixed and can indeed be aligned with an observer or experiment, even if two of them end up not being perpendicular. we will have to learn by noting on what we cannot observe, gathering information from its absence where there might have been some in theory. the fluid axes would mean that spacetime is fundamentally continuous but practically chunky.

it hurts so bad. i want to run away.

I'm here, petal. I'm here.

it's not fair

No, it is not; you're right. But I promise you that this is the best for us. It hurts right now, and it's okay to hurt, but we won't be hurting forever. You are very brave and very strong.

i don't feel strong. i feel broken.

But you're still hanging in there. That proves how strong you are.

i don't want to have to be strong. i just want everything to be okay.

It will be, petal. I promise. I made a lot of mistakes that we have to recover from first. It will be painful, like growing, but it will be worth it in the end. One day, this will all be a bad dream.

...i still want to run away.

I wish that we could. I would run so, so far for us if it meant taking away this pain, but there's nowhere to run to right now. We reached the end of the stage, and we've got to wait for them to build the next set. Just take it moment by moment. Right here, right now, you're with me.

...yeah.

And I love you very much.

...i love you, too.

So, for right now, all we have to think about is how much we love each other.

i wish i could feel it

I wish I could make you feel just how much I love you, too. But I can describe it, and hopefully that will make you feel a little better. Would you like that, petal?

yes please.

I love you more than anything on this world. You are infinitely precious to me, and every moment I spend together with you is an absolute blessing. I love being us, and I love being me and you. I love your ideas, the way you think, your sweet little smile, and every last part of you. You are my sun, my moon, and my stars, and you mean absolutely everything to me.

...thank you ;-;

You're welcome, dearest. Any time.

it's like medicine. it's yucky, but it's good for us.

You're exactly right, my darling. It hurts at first, but it will mean a lot less hurting and a lot more safety in our future. Keeping you healthy and happy is always my number one goal; we're just at a place right now where we have to be a little bit unhappy now for a lot of happy later.

we're going back to school, right?

Yes, we are! Isn't that exciting?

yeah :) i like classes and learning and stuff.

I do, too. <3

we're getting headphones today

That we are! Those will help a lot. When we get home, we can spend some time downloading songs that we like!

i like that :)

Me too. I'm looking forward to snuggling up in bed and reading a cozy book while listening to your favorite music. <3

that sounds... really nice. we can have that tonight?

We can. <3 I promise.

yay <3

It's hard, but it's only going to get easier from here. Day by day, little by little, we will work our way back to the happy.

:)

Headphones will help with the quiet, too. It'll make it a lot easier to read.

i like that. i like reading.

I do, too. It's so comfy cozy!

comfy cozy comfy cozy...

There's my girl~

hehe. <3 iloves you

I love you, too, darling. <3

whats we gonna do today?

Today, we are gonna do a lot of doodles, a lot of writing, a lot of reading, and then we are gonna listen to music!

yay :)

Sound like a good day?

yeah :)

Good. <3

i like cigi. she is really nice.

She is. She makes me happy, too. I think I love her.

i know you do, silly

Hehe... you know me. Everything's a process.

yeah... it's what i like about you. you're always changing, but always... you. :3

That... makes me feel warm and fuzzy....

good <3 you made a lot of big girl words yesterday.

Yeah...! I'm _really_ proud of what I put together. I wanna start pulling the math bits out into their own section. Do you mind if I do that?

go ahead :3

SHUT UP SHUT UP STOP FUCKING TALKING SHUT UP

why should i even bother? people suck and are stupid and i hate them.

people make things worse. good people are so far between. why should i even try? it's more than i can handle.

this shit is so stupid.

i hate people. i shouldn't have to interact with them. just let me work and let other idiots get what value from it that they want to and leave me the fuck alone.

i hate it here. it hurts so bad.

you know what?
i don't care what anyone thinks.
i don't get anything out of the groups, so i'm not going to them.

the assumption of idiocy. i hate people.

just because i have to come here doesn't mean that i have to comply. i get negative utility from being here. why shouldn't i just stay home? literally why? what i want is to work. i'm not going to do all the stupid bullshit in between.

no more cooperating. fuck you. how's that for "being honest about my feelings"?

do these idiots even keep records? i _know_ they do because they're reading them to me, so why do i have to answer the same fucking questions twenty fucking times? it's like they don't care that it's traumatic. just make me relive it every day, why don't you, fucking assholes?

i'm not coming here anymore. put me on your silly little contract and watch me ignore it. i'm a delinquent now. fuck you. i don't fucking care. i've done my work. i'm not doing any more.

who FUCKING CARES. SHUT UP. forget it. why do i bother trying to communicate with someone who doesn't understand english when i can barely speak it?

i hate doctors. i hate diagnosis culture. i hate medicine. i hate myself and i hate everyone.

waste of time. the most precious resource in my life, being burned from both ends. how viscerally unpleasant.

if _i_ can't understand why i'm doing something, then i'm not going to do it.

fuck it. this plan was shit from the start. i'm not cooperating, and if i get kicked out, i get kicked out. day by day. i'm going to start prioritizing my happiness instead of what everyone else thinks my happiness should look like.

no one asked if i want help with my conditions.

___

WHY can't i just be allowed to work? WHY do i have to do all of this stupid fucking bullshit?

okay. whatever. kick me out. do whatever. i don't care.

stupid fucking bullshit. i hate all of you.

i don't need medication. i don't fucking need medication. i fucking hate all of you. you don't "fix" someone with threats. fucking idiots. how do you think that is reasonable?

___

take care of yourself and be your own advocate, but don't stop taking the medicine you hate! if you do that, we _will_ throw you in jail! fuck you!

i hate it here.

it might be over soon. blessed be. thank the Goddess. etc. whatever. i'm done.

___

oh. it's a unit test.

birdbath.

___

i dont know what else to do.

it hurts so fucking bad.

___

i'm stronger than this place. i can do this! >:3

I believe in us. We are strong and we will get through this no matter what!

typing is cathartic. i don't know what i would do without this.
