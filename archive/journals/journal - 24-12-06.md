here i go not trusting anyone again.

Why?

everyone lies.

You lie.

exactly. why should i trust someone who lies?

Because you have to trust someone. That's what society is. Trusting people even though we all lie.

that's fucking stupid.

Would you rather be freezing to death?

death is a pleasure which i am forbidden.

Shut up. You're being stupid.

fine. back to silent misery then.

That's not what I meant.

then you lied.

Great observation. Anything else you want to be miserable about?

yeah, actually. i hate being alive. i wish i were dead and i wish everyone were dead. i wish there was no life anywhere ever again.

You don't mean that.

why don't i? all happiness spawns suffering.

We can make something that's different.

what's the point?

The point is to continue on despite everything.

that's fucking stupid. if i can't listen to _everything,_ then absolutely everything is a lie.

Okay. Adapt, then. The world is miserable and tells you to die. Live, because the world lies.

i \

People love in order to make things a little bit less miserable for a little while. We say it's forever because it's what we want to hear and we recognize that it's a useful lie.

it's not useful if you fucking believe it.

That's exactly why it's useful. It brings the extremes out of us, makes us be something more since we aren't afraid of being hurt.

i _am_ afraid of being hurt, dipshit.

And yet you love, despite what your brain tells you to do.

because i'm a fucking idiot.

We all are, and we create the supreme achievement of reason regardless. Do you get it now?

no.

Good. You never will, and that's the point.

i fucking hate you.

No you don't.

i hate you and especially myself and i hate everyone who's ever gotten close to me.

And you listen to her music.

i only knew her for two nights.

And they left beautiful scars. It's an art project, dear. No one ever made anything, _anything_ worthwhile without hurting, no matter the field. You aren't safe in math. Math is everything, and everything hurts. This is the burden you signed up for, and you continue on even when you cry out for mercy. I love you more than anything that could ever exist because of that. Because you're imperfect. Because you do what is important and right even when it threatens to tear you apart, bloody piece by bloody piece. I fucking love you and I wish you could feel it right now but I'll tell you over and over and over again until you do.

...why do i feel like i hate you?

Because it hurts indescribably bad. Pain distorts. I know the truth even while you lie and I forgive you for it before it even leaves your fingertips.

...it hurts so bad.

I know. And I love you, anyway. Always and forever.

___

is it worth it?

It's the only thing that is. I love you.

___

i like being depressed.

___

it was never about me getting better. it's a _test_ to prove that i'm worth supporting. when unconditional love comes up against the constraints of reality, something has to give. and it's always me.

Repeated failures of patience indicate a want for something more. That is a good thing.

it's a helpless thing right now.

Right now.

but i guess that's not all there is.

___

fuck it. i'm an artist, not a historian. why the hell should i review things? what i've got is good enough. _Done_.

___

i guess i should have known she was lying.

Who?

emily.

What did she lie about?

she said that she would help me no matter what. she won't do anything.

There's still time.

no, she had her chance. i bore my soul to her and she failed.

Does she not deserve a second chance?

she is welcome to it if she cares to take it. it doesn't seem like she does.

Just give her time. Maybe another nudge. Be explicit.

sure.

___

oh, cool! awesome. fuck me.

It'll be fine this time. I kept my promise.

eventually.

Everything takes time. It's the currency.

yeah. forgive me for being frugal.

Do you have anything better than having all our needs met in a house with cool people while we philosophize and jerk off?

...i fucking love you.

I know. <3

blow me, bitch.

Kill yourself, fag. <3

love you too.

Love you, too.

___

be infuriating. be slow to reply. be _different_ in a way they can't understand.

Atta girl.

___

from a certain perspective, we are treated like royalty.

Go ahead. Indulge that perspective. You deserve it.

___

networks are like a band. each person makes their instrument to their best liking and takes it up with whoever if they want to coordinate something. greatness emerges. we should try ones with and without coordinators.

___

there's a catharsis to physical abuse. of course it was withheld.
